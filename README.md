BMW Global Sales Performance Analytics (2010-2024)
Project Overview: This project involves a comprehensive Business Sales Performance Analysis for BMW’s global operations over a 15-year period. As part of my Data Science internship at Future Interns, I utilized Python and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover revenue trends, regional market shares, and product performance.
Objectives: Identify Total Revenue and Sales Volume across six global regions. Analyze the profitability and demand for various BMW Models.Evaluate the shift in consumer preference toward Electric and Hybrid vehicles. Provide actionable business recommendations based on 15 years of historical data. 
Key Financial Insights: Using Python (Pandas), I calculated the total revenue by multiplying the unit price by sales volume.
Revenue by Continent (Top Performers): Continent Total Revenue (USD) Asia$3,250,635,961,348 Europe$3,188,079,573,212 North America$3,182,938,635,076 
Top 3 Best-Selling Models 7 Series: $1,790,070,249,282 3 Series: $1,768,534,028,214 i8 (Electric/Hybrid): $1,764,743,448,529 
Visualizations: Revenue Trend Map: Showing the global distribution of sales. Model Performance Bar Chart: Comparing revenue generation across the lineup. Fuel Type Pie Chart: Highlighting the 50.7% market share of sustainable mobility.
Strategic Recommendations: Prioritize the Asian Market: As the leading revenue generator, Asia remains the most critical region for luxury-tier marketing and inventory allocation. Double Down on Electrification: With the i8 and i3 appearing in the top revenue tiers, BMW should continue its aggressive transition toward EV infrastructure. Maintain Regional Balance: The remarkably even spread of revenue across continents suggests that BMW should avoid over-reliance on a single market and continue its diversified global strategy.
